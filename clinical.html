			Dr. Mohandessi has based his private practice on the micro-practice model: lower overhead, fewer patients and greater availability
			to his patients. Patients come to psychiatric treatment for various reasons including the sudden occurrence of crises
			and the presence of lifelong issues. Most will seek relief of their symptoms and suffering. By creating an atmosphere
			conducive to trust, self-exploration, insight and change, Dr. Mohandessi works with his patients to alleviate their symptoms
			and enhance their mental well-being.
		</p>

		<p>
			Dr. Mohandessi is an expert in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy. In his practice, he utilizes both psychiatric medications
			and talk therapies with an emphasis on fostering a strong therapeutic alliance. Dr. Mohandessi is trained and experienced
			in supportive and insight-oriented psychotherapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical-behavioral
			therapy (DBT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy (PD).
		</p>

		<p>
			Dr. Mohandessi is also available for Second-Opinion Consultation which does not include treatment. If you are already in
			treatment with a psychiatrist, you or your psychiatrist can arrange for a Second-Opinion Consultation by calling Dr. Mohandessi's
			office. Dr. Mohandessi will work with you and your psychiatrist to enhance your existing treatment.
