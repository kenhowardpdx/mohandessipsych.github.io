<h4>Diagnostic Phase</h4>

During the Diagnostic Phase, Dr. Mohandessi will gather more information about your symptoms and difficulties to make an appropriate diagnosis.  He may also recommend obtaining prior medical records or refer you for a medical consultation and work-up.  This Phase is also an opportunity for you to get to know Dr. Mohandessi's practice and decide if it is a good fit for you.  By the end of the Diagnostic Phase, Dr. Mohandessi will share with you his findings and treatment recommendations.  If you both agree, Dr. Mohandessi will become your psychiatrist and you will enter treatment with him.</p>

<h4>Long-term Treatment Phase</h4>

<p>Once your symptoms are brought under control and the short-term goals of your treatment have been met, you may enter the Long-term Treatment Phase.
