        <p>
            For individuals interested in treatment, the following is what you can expect:
        </p>

        <h4>Phone Introduction</h4>

        <p>
            As a potential patient, you will call Dr. Mohandessi and arrange for a phone introduction. During a brief phone introduction,
            Dr. Mohandessi will inquire about your symptoms and reason for seeking treatment. He will orient you to his practice
            and schedule. Based on Dr. Mohandessi's availability, you will be able to schedule an Initial Evaluation appointment.
            After arranging your appointment, please visit the Forms section and review the New Patient Forms prior to your
            appointment.

        </p>

        <h4>Initial Evaluation</h4>

        <p>
            Dr. Mohandessi's Initial Evaluation may last between 60 and 90 minutes. Please arrive at least 15 minutes prior to your appointment
            to complete the necessary Forms. During the Initial Evaluation, Dr. Mohandessi will ask about your personal,
            medical, psychiatric, and family histories while listening to your concerns. Your openness with Dr. Mohandessi
            will allow him to understand your difficulties, come to a diagnosis and form an appropriate treatment plan.

        </p>

        <h4>Diagnostic Phase</h4>

        <p>
            Depending on the case, Dr. Mohandessi may require one to two additional 50 minutes sessions to complete a thorough evaluation
            of your case. During the Diagnostic Phase, Dr. Mohandessi will gather more information about your symptoms and
            difficulties to make an appropriate diagnosis. He may also recommend obtaining prior medical records or refer
            you for a medical consultation and work-up. This Phase is also an opportunity for you to get to know Dr. Mohandessi's
            practice and decide if it is a good fit for you. By the end of the Diagnostic Phase, Dr. Mohandessi will share
            with you his findings and treatment recommendations. If you both agree, Dr. Mohandessi will become your psychiatrist
            and you will enter treatment with him.

        </p>

        <h4>Short-term Treatment Phase</h4>

        <p>
            After entering treatment with Dr. Mohandessi, The Short-term Treatment Phase will focus on amelioration and management of
            the symptoms that led you to treatment. This Phase of treatment may last several weeks to months and involves
            regular appointments. The Short-term Treatment Phase may vary from patient-to-patient and include medication
            management and/or psychotherapy. During this phase, you and Dr. Mohandessi will be able to discuss your goals
            and expectations for treatment. Overall, Dr. Mohandessi will work with you towards bringing your symptoms under
            control.

        </p>

        <h4>Long-term Treatment Phase</h4>

        <p>
            Once your symptoms are brought under control and the short-term goals of your treatment have been met, you may enter the
            Long-term Treatment Phase. This Phase of treatment may last between several months to years and also consists
            of regular appointments. The focus of treatment will transition to life issues such as your relationships, self-awareness,
            self-esteem, productivity, individual efficacy and life satisfaction. Dr. Mohandessi strives to guide his patients
            through stages of greater understanding and insight toward lasting change and enhanced mental well-being.
